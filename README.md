Finding our best-performing salespeople and products

What are our best products and salespeople, and how can we use this information to improve our overall performance?
1.  Load the database and ensure you can run basic queries against it
2.  Look at how product ratings and total sales are related
3.  See how products sell in different subcategories (bikes, helmets, socks, etc.)
4.  Calculate which salespeople performed the best in 2014
5.  See if total sales are correlated with commission percentage
